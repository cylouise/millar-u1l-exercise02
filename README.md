Steps on how to create GitHub page
1.To publish a GitHub Pages site, go to the settings of the created repository. Look under "Code and Automation" and click on "Pages".

2. In the "Source" section, select the branch you want to use. Then, click the "Save" button.

3. If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the "Custom domain" section of the GitHub Pages settings. This allows you to use your own domain name instead of the default GitHub Pages URL.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
This course has been a delightful experience for me as it allows me to delve into a new field and nurture my creativity. While I wouldn't consider myself particularly artistic or inclined towards design, I've found joy in the process here. However, I often struggle with deciding on the appropriate colors and fonts to use, as I lack confidence in blending them harmoniously. Despite this challenge, I'm eager to learn and improve my design skills.
