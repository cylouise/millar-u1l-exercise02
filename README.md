What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
This course has been a delightful experience for me as it allows me to delve into a new field and nurture my creativity. While I wouldn't consider myself particularly artistic or inclined towards design, I've found joy in the process here. However, I often struggle with deciding on the appropriate colors and fonts to use, as I lack confidence in blending them harmoniously. Despite this challenge, I'm eager to learn and improve my design skills.
